    - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is the service worker key from the Supabase project
    - `SECRET` is a secret that should be set on the server and the OC script (see below) to prevent unauthorized access
4. (optional) if OC is on a minecraft server (not your PC) then install `ngrok` and run `ngrok http 3000` to get a public url for testing

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
